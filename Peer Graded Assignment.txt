## SMOOTILLUSIONS MACHINE LEARNING FINAL PROJECT LOGIC
 
## Prep the Data
 
# remove variables with nearly zero variance
 
# remove variables that are almost always NA

# remove variables that don't make intuitive sense for prediction 
 
## Build the model

# instruct train to use 3-fold CV to select optimal tuning parameters

## Problem with Packages loading ( if loaded correctly ## the next 2 lines out )
 
# fit model on ptrain1

# print final model to see tuning parameters it chose
 
##Evaluate the model
 
# use model to predict classe in validation set (ptrain2)

# show confusion matrix to get estimate of out-of-sample error

## Retrain the model
 
# remove variables with nearly zero variance

# remove variables that are almost always NA
 
# remove variables that don't make intuitive sense for prediction (X, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp), which happen to be the first five variables
  
# re-fit model using full training set (ptrain)
  
## Make Predctions
 
# predict on test set
 
# convert predictions to character vector
 
# create function to write predictions to files
 
# create prediction files
